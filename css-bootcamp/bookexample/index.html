    <h1>This is a test</h1>
    <p>
      At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and
      publisher-photo-services." But professional photographers do not produce
      one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are
      supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications
      with most of their prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought
      from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the average, and
      sometimes smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in
      order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett
      says, himself a success at selling his photographs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised
      if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our
      country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the
      attention of the world now and then. [emphasize] This is a delusion. The
      real triumph is that of the photographer who utilises the material ready
      at hand in his own district, be it large or small."[end]
    </p>
    <p>
      And more, a person does not have to be an expert photographer in order to
      succeed at the work. Here is what one prominent writer says about it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The requirements of the field are well within the capabilities of even
      the beginner in photography, viz.; the ability to make good negatives and
      good prints, the ability to recognise news-value, and a methodical plan to
      find the market where the prints will find acceptance. The man or woman
      who can meet these requirements should be fairly successful from the
      beginning, and will open up quickly new avenues of special work and
      profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such is not
      at all necessary to the successful selling of photographs to publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the field overcrowded? [emphasis]No.[end] If there were ten times as
      many persons engaged in the work they could all keep themselves busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field—how wide is it? Get out your map of the world. The field for
      [emphasis]making [end] photographs extends from the top margin to the
      bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for [emphasis]selling
      [end] photographs—which is more to the point—extends over about five
      thousand publications which use prints; not to speak of a few score of
      other markets.
